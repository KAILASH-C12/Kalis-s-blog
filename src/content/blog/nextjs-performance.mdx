# Boost Your Next.js Performance

Performance is king. In this post, we explore several techniques to make your Next.js app fly.

## 1. Image Optimization

Always use the `next/image` component. It automatically serves optimized images in modern formats like WebP and AVIF.

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image'
import hero from '../public/hero.jpg'

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <Image 
      src={hero}
      alt="Hero Image"
      placeholder="blur"
      priority
    />
  )
}
```

## 2. Font Optimization

Use `next/font` to automatically optimize your fonts and remove layout shift.

## 3. Dynamic Imports

Use `next/dynamic` for heavy components that are not critical for the initial paint.

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic'

const HeavyChart = dynamic(() => import('../components/HeavyChart'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false,
})
```

## Conclusion

By applying these simple techniques, you can significantly improve your Lighthouse score.
