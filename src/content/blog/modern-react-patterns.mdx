# Mastering Modern React Patterns

React has evolved significantly over the years. In 2026, we are seeing a shift towards more server-centric patterns with **React Server Components (RSC)**, while keeping client interactivity granular.

## The Rise of Server Components

Server Components allow us to render components on the server, reducing the bundle size sent to the client.

```tsx
// This component runs entirely on the server
async function BlogPost({ slug }: { slug: string }) {
  const content = await db.posts.find(slug)
  return <article>{content}</article>
}
```

## Composition Pattern

One of the most powerful patterns in React is **Composition**. Instead of prop drilling, we can use `children` prop.

<div className="bg-secondary p-4 rounded-lg my-4">
  <strong>Tip:</strong> Always prefer composition over inheritance or complex prop drilling.
</div>

## Custom Hooks

Custom hooks are still the standard for sharing stateful logic.

```ts
export function useToggle(initial = false) {
  const [on, setOn] = useState(initial)
  const toggle = () => setOn(p => !p)
  return [on, toggle] as const
}
```

## Conclusion

Mastering these patterns will help you build scalable and maintainable React applications.
